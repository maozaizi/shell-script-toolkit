## About This Repo

This code repository serves as a storage space for various shell scripts I've developed while tinkering around. It includes scripts for setting up environments, installing MariaDB, installing Nginx, and backing up WordPress sites, among other operations. As a beginner, I aim to document my tinkering experiences here.
